Aws Regions = AWS has the concept of a Region, which is a physical location around the world where we cluster data centers

We call each group of logical data centers an Availability Zone


This are regions us-east-1, us-west-1 ... and under regions are availiablity zones(AZ's)

(AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region.
All AZs in an AWS Region are interconnected with high-bandwidth, low-latency networking, over fully redundant, 
dedicated metro fiber providing high-throughput, low-latency networking between AZs. 
All traffic between AZs is encrypted. The network performance is sufficient to accomplish synchronous replication between AZs
us-east-1a, us-east-1b


if theres issue in us-east-1a it will not affect us-east-1b unless its some big issue , as AZs are independent fault tolerant

Vpc has network range and that network range is across all the subnets
A VPC can have a minimum of 16 addresses, using the CIDR netmask /28 , and a maximum of 65,536 addresses, using the netmask /16 .

Edge location.
Edge Location are smaller packets of infrastructure distributed globally
Edge locations are AWS data centers designed to deliver services with the lowest latency possible.
